# 🐛 Pokémon Favorites

You can heart your favorite pokémon monsters. Adding the Pokémon card to your favorites also saves that pokémon in your local storage so when you come back, your faves are already displayed. I made this app for an assignment to build a favorites list application using an api. The **API** I used is [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). It has many awesome features it comes with.

## 🚀 Features

- **Special Cards Effect:** Special cards shows an animation for the rarity of the pokemon.
  - Legendary cards are orange.
  - Baby cards are blue with no animation.
  - Mythic cards are blue and purple.
  - Common cards have no animation or color change.
- **Save your Favorites:** Clicking on a Pokémon will add to your favorites' section below.
- **API Integrated:** All Pokémon data fetched using the **PokiAPI**.
- **Light/Dark Mode:** Set the theme to your liking.
- **Saved Cache:** Your theme and favorites are saved inside Local Storage.
- **Responsive Design:** App works on mobile and desktop screens.
- **Handy Search UI:** Typing the pokemon can start fetching for the pokemon already and display it inside pokedex.

## 🤔 Improvements

- **UX-Search:**
  1. It would be better to display all pokémon all at once when they have all been fetched and loaded.
  2. Also to display a load progress bar to show how much more is being loaded.
  3. If pokedex is empty it can fetch all pokémon.
  4. Clicking enter or the search Icon should start the fetch for the single pokémon.
- **Navigation UI:** Clicking on search won't with other elements. Make when user types 3 characters in search, then its fetches all pokémon that match so far: caps or no-caps.
- **Code Cleanup:** Code is little messy. Needs some better organization.

## 🏗️ Development

I build this project for an assignment for Devslopes academy as a 'vanilla js' project. We were tasked to build a favorites card web app that shows list of data and user is able to save there likings. This is the first project I made using an API.

## ⚒️ Technologies

- `HTML`
- `CSS`
- `Vanilla JS`

## 🐞 Bugs

- **Navigation Search Input:** The user has to spell the pokémon in capitalized format or the won't be fetched.
