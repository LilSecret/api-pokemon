# 🐛 Pokémon Favorites

You can heart your favorite pokémon monsters. Adding the Pokémon card to your favorites also saves that pokémon in your local storage so when you come back, your faves are already displayed. I made this app for an assignment to build a favorites list application using an api. The **API** I used is [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). It has many awesome features it comes with.

## 🚀 Features

- **Special Cards Effect:** Special cards shows an animation for the rarity of the pokemon.
  - Legendary cards are orange.
  - Baby cards are blue with no animation.
  - Mythic cards are blue and purple.
  - Common cards have no animation or color change.
- **Save your Favorites:** Clicking on a Pokémon will add to your favorites' section below.
- **API Integrated:** All Pokémon data fetched using the **PokiAPI**.
- **Light/Dark Mode:** Set the theme to your liking.
- **Saved Cache:** Your theme and favorites are saved inside Local Storage.
- **Responsive Design:** App works on mobile and desktop screens.
- **Handy Search UI:** Typing the pokemon can start fetching for the pokemon already and display it inside pokedex.

## ⚒️ Technologies

- `HTML`
- `CSS`
- `Vanilla JS`

## 🏗️ Development

I built this project for an assignment for Devslopes Academy as a 'vanilla JS' project. We were tasked with creating a favorites card web app that displays a list of cards created from fetched data. Additionally, we were required to allow users to save their preferences. This is the first project I have completed using an API.

## 🤔 Improvements

- **User Experience:**
  1. It would be better to display all pokémon all at once when they have all been fetched and loaded.
  2. Add a load progress bar to show how close things are to be loaded.
- **Code Cleanup:** Code is little messy. Needs some better organization.

## 🐞 Bugs

- **None so far:** I tested it and haven't found any currently.
